# JSChallenges
This is part of a series of (ongoing) mini-challenges designed to assess, review, and improve your JavasScript skills.   

- They are scaffolded to go progressively from easy to hard.
- These are designed with COMP1800 and COMP2800 in mind.
- Each exercise is self-contained and meant to be done within 15 minutes.
- Each challenge is a branch
